## Purpose

Singaporeâ€™s hawker culture is recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. However, many hawker centers still remain as hidden gems; and food lovers often struggle to find stalls that match their tastes and dietary needs. Long queues, crowded venues and lack of info turn customers to other options such as fast food and restaurants. HawkerGo was developed to help solve these problems.

The project aims to:
* **Improve accessibility:** Make it easy for users to find hawker centers near them.
* **Encourage food discovery:** Recommend stalls based on customer preferences.
* **Support hawkers:** Empower hawkers with digital capabilities, improve their order handling capabilities, increase their revenue and provide advanced stall analytics.
